# Daily Proposal List Template

- Date: 2026-01-31
- Generated at: 04:30 AM Central Time
- Purpose: To spark new directions, improve context awareness, and adapt the agent/daemon to user needs and abstract concepts.

## 10 Proposals for Exploration

1. Enhance the daemon to actively log and summarize user context and intent.
2. Implement automatic README and changelog updates with timestamps and reasons for every significant change.
3. Develop a journaling system that tracks not just actions, but the rationale and context behind them.
4. Create a bridge module that translates abstract user goals into actionable agent tasks.
5. Schedule daily context review and proposal generation at 4:30 AM Central Time.
6. Build templates for idea files, proposals, and context summaries to standardize documentation.
7. Integrate a feedback loop where the agent asks clarifying questions when context is ambiguous.
8. Enable the daemon to suggest new directions or improvements based on recent user activity and logs.
9. Maintain a running list of open questions, hypotheses, and abstract concepts for ongoing exploration.
10. Automate the creation of "idea" files whenever a novel or profound concept is detected in user input.
