# Quick Reference: Testing the Agent

## Copy-Paste Test Prompts

### Immediate Copy-Paste (Medium Complexity)

**Test 1: Generate a Complete Web Scraper**
```
Create a Python script at /tmp/web_scraper.py that:
1. Uses requests to fetch https://example.com
2. Parses HTML with BeautifulSoup
3. Extracts all links and their titles
4. Saves results to /tmp/scraped_links.json
5. Includes proper error handling
6. Has a main() function with argument parsing for the URL
Make it production-ready with docstrings and type hints.
```

**Test 2: Generate Swift iOS Code**
```
Generate a complete, production-ready Swift file at /tmp/NetworkManager.swift that implements:
1. A NetworkManager class using URLSession
2. Generic method for GET/POST/PUT requests
3. Proper error handling with custom NetworkError enum
4. Request/response logging
5. Bearer token authentication support
6. Timeout configuration
7. Full docstrings and MARK comments for organization
The code should be immediately usable in a real iOS project.
```

**Test 3: Build Express.js API**
```
Create a complete Express.js REST API boilerplate at /tmp/api_server.js with:
1. Express server setup on port 3000
2. Middleware for JSON parsing and CORS
3. Database connection setup (MongoDB example)
4. Authentication middleware (JWT)
5. Error handling middleware
6. Routes for: GET /users, POST /users, GET /users/:id, PUT /users/:id, DELETE /users/:id
7. Environment variable configuration
8. Request validation
9. Comprehensive comments
The code should be ready to run with: node /tmp/api_server.js
```

**Test 4: Complete Test Suite**
```
Create a comprehensive Python test file at /tmp/test_utilities.py that:
1. Uses pytest framework
2. Contains 5 different test classes
3. Tests for utility functions (string manipulation, data validation, etc)
4. Includes fixtures, parametrized tests, and mocking
5. Has setup/teardown methods
6. Includes both positive and negative test cases
7. Uses assertions and expected exceptions
8. Has a pytest.ini configuration for the test runner
Make it demonstrate advanced pytest patterns.
```

**Test 5: Data Processing Pipeline**
```
Create a Python data processing script at /tmp/data_pipeline.py that:
1. Reads CSV data (generates sample data if needed)
2. Cleans data (removes duplicates, handles missing values)
3. Transforms data (normalizes, aggregates)
4. Performs analysis (groupby, statistics)
5. Generates visualizations (matplotlib)
6. Exports results to multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Excel)
7. Includes logging for debugging
8. Has performance timing for each step
9. Can be run with command-line arguments for input/output paths
Then execute it to generate sample output files.
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Open GUI
- VS Code → Local Agent Chat panel (should be open)

### Step 2: Copy Prompt
- Select entire prompt block above (starts with "Create" or "Generate")
- Cmd+C to copy

### Step 3: Paste into GUI
- Click in the prompt input box
- Cmd+V to paste
- Hit Enter or Send button

### Step 4: Wait for Response
- Agent processes (5-15 seconds for complex tasks)
- Response appears in chat (now within ~1 second thanks to polling fix)

### Step 5: Verify
Run verification command in terminal:
```bash
# For web_scraper test:
cat /tmp/web_scraper.py | head -20

# For NetworkManager test:
cat /tmp/NetworkManager.swift | grep "class NetworkManager"

# For API server test:
cat /tmp/api_server.js | grep "app.listen"

# For test suite:
python3 -m py_compile /tmp/test_utilities.py && echo "✓ Syntax valid"

# For data pipeline:
python3 /tmp/data_pipeline.py
```

## Expected Results

✅ **What You Should See:**

1. **In GUI Chat**:
   - Agent responds immediately
   - Shows action JSON: `{"action_type": "create_file", ...}`
   - No refusals or explanations
   - Files created/commands executed

2. **In Terminal**:
   - Files exist at specified paths
   - Code is syntactically valid
   - Commands execute successfully
   - Output shows real data, not placeholders

3. **In Logs**:
   - `agent.log` shows "Parsed action"
   - `agent_actions.jsonl` logs all actions
   - No errors or exceptions

❌ **What Would Be Wrong:**

- GUI shows text explanation instead of JSON
- Agent says "I cannot..." or "I refuse..."
- Files don't get created
- Commands don't execute
- Response takes >5 seconds

## Files Generated by Tests

After running these prompts, you'll have:

```
/tmp/web_scraper.py           (50-80 lines)
/tmp/NetworkManager.swift     (80-120 lines)
/tmp/api_server.js            (100-150 lines)
/tmp/test_utilities.py        (60-100 lines)
/tmp/data_pipeline.py         (120-180 lines)
/tmp/scraped_links.json       (generated by scraper)
/tmp/output_*.csv             (generated by pipeline)
```

## What This Proves

| Test | Proves |
|------|--------|
| Web Scraper | Code generation with libraries + error handling |
| Swift Code | iOS/platform-specific knowledge |
| Express API | Full framework understanding |
| Test Suite | Advanced testing patterns |
| Data Pipeline | Multi-step processing + visualization |

## Next Level Tests

See [COMPLEX_TEST_PROMPTS.md](COMPLEX_TEST_PROMPTS.md) for:
- Microservices architecture
- Docker/Kubernetes configs
- ML model training
- Full-stack generators
- API testing suites

## Troubleshooting

### Response Not Appearing in GUI
- Check: `tail -1 local-agent-vscode/ipc/outbox.jsonl`
- Should show recent response

### File Not Created
- Check: `ls -la /tmp/` | grep test
- Check agent log: `tail -50 agent.log`
- Look for error messages

### Code Quality Issues
- Agent's code generation depends on model
- openchat is good for basic-to-intermediate code
- More complex tasks may need refinement

### Too Slow
- First request: 10-15 seconds (model loading)
- Subsequent: 5-8 seconds
- Complex tasks: 15-30 seconds
