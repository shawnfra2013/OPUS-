# AI Xcode Integration Manifest

- All code in this folder is managed by your AI agent.
- The AI will always consult Copilot for best practices, debugging, and Apple platform guidelines before generating or modifying code.
- You do not need to open Xcode unless you want to build, run, or debug the app manually.
- The AI can:
  - Generate and update Swift/ObjC files
  - Create and edit SwiftUI views, storyboards, and project configs
  - Run Xcode build/test commands from VS Code
  - Keep all code under version control
- If the AI needs to check or improve anything, it will consult Copilot automatically.
- All project structure, naming, and architecture will follow Apple and industry best practices.
